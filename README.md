# Auracoin
Aurora's new cryptocurrency integrated with Aurachain. [aur.xyz](https://aur.xyz)

## What is Auracoin?
Auracoin is a new cryptocurrency designed to be easy to use and get involved
with. It is written in Python, and thus is very portable. It takes on average
just 2 minutes to mine blocks, making transactions between people fast and
reliable. Auracoin uses its own implementation of blockchain, called Aurachain,
which helps secure transactions. It uses peer-to-peer technologies to enable the
decentralisation of ledgers.

## How can I get involved?
There are many ways that you can get involved with Auracoin, listed below.

### Mine Auracoin
The Auracoin implementation is designed to store incoming transactions, verify
them and secure them by mining them. The more people who want to take part in
mining, the securer Auracoin can be!
